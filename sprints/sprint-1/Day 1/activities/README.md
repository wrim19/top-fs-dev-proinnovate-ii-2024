## Program Phases

- **Introduction: (2 sprints) - Pair Project**: In this phase, students will learn to set up their work environment (development) at a professional level, review the necessary JavaScript tools for developing web applications, and become familiar with best practices for team software development.
- **Main Phase: (10 sprints) - Group Project**: In this phase, students will apply the necessary concepts to delve deeper into scalable web application development. Throughout this period, they will learn and master the skills needed to collaborate on implementing a group project, addressing more specific and advanced topics in web development.
- **Final Phase: (2 sprints) - Individual Project**: In this final stage, the bootcamp challenges students to develop an MVP individually, using emerging technologies in web development. The goal is to apply acquired knowledge through tools like GraphQL, Serverless, Next.js, Headless CMS, among others, fostering creativity and innovation skills.
